# NMLabs
My labs for Numerical Methods

Whole code to every lab may be found in main.cpp file

Lab1 - inverse matrix using Gauss elimination

Lab2 - LU method to solve SLE

Lab3 - Jacobi method to solve SLE 

Lab4 - Power method to find the biggest by module eigen value and its eigen vector

Lab5 - Solving ln(x) + (x + 1)^3  == 0 equation or solving k1 * ln(x) + k2(k3 * x + k4) ^ k5 == 0 using Successive Approximations
